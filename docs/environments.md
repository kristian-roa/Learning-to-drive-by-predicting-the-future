# Environments

This is a list of Gym environments, including those packaged with Gym, official OpenAI environments, and third party environment.

For information on creating your own environment, see [Creating your own Environment](creating-environments.md).

## Included Environments

The code for each environment group is housed in its own subdirectory
[gym/envs](https://github.com/openai/gym/blob/master/gym/envs). The
specification of each task is in
[gym/envs/\_\_init\_\_.py](https://github.com/openai/gym/blob/master/gym/envs/__init__.py).
It's worth browsing through both.

### Atari

The Atari environments are provided by the [Arcade Learning Environment](https://github.com/mgbellemare/Arcade-Learning-Environment) (ALE).
If you didn't do the full install, you can install dependencies via `pip install -e '.[atari]'` which will install `ale-py`.
You can then create any of the legacy Atari environments as such:
``` python
import gym

env = gym.make('SpaceInvaders-v4')
```

Newer versions of the Atari environments live in the [ALE](https://github.com/mgbellemare/Arcade-Learning-Environment) repository
and are namespaced with `ALE`. For example, the `v5` environments can be included as such:

```python
import gym
import ale_py

env = gym.make('ALE/SpaceInvaders-v5')
```

Note: ROMs are not distributed by the ALE but tools are provided in the ALE to manage ROMs.
Please see the project's documentation on importing ROMs.

### Box2d

Box2d is a 2D physics engine. You can install it via `pip install -e
'.[box2d]'` and then get started as follows:

``` python
import gym
env = gym.make('LunarLander-v2')
env.reset()
env.render()
```

### Classic control

These are a variety of classic control tasks, which would appear in a
typical reinforcement learning textbook. If you didn't do the full
install, you will need to run `pip install -e '.[classic_control]'` to
enable rendering. You can get started with them via:

``` python
import gym
env = gym.make('CartPole-v1')
env.reset()
env.render()
```

### MuJoCo

[MuJoCo](http://www.mujoco.org/) is a physics engine which can do very
detailed efficient simulations with contacts. It's not open-source, so
you'll have to follow the instructions in
[mujoco-py](https://github.com/openai/mujoco-py#obtaining-the-binaries-and-license-key)
to set it up. You'll have to also run `pip install -e '.[mujoco]'` if
you didn't do the full install.

``` python
import gym
env = gym.make('Humanoid-v2')
env.reset()
env.render()
```

### Robotics

These environments also use [MuJoCo](http://www.mujoco.org/). You'll have to also run `pip install -e '.[robotics]'` if
you didn't do the full install.

``` python
import gym
env = gym.make('HandManipulateBlock-v2')
env.reset()
env.render()
```

You can also find additional details in the accompanying [technical
report](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.09464) and [blog
post](https://blog.openai.com/ingredients-for-robotics-research/). If
you use these environments, you can cite them as follows:

    @misc{1802.09464,
      Author = {Matthias Plappert and Marcin Andrychowicz and Alex Ray and Bob McGrew and Bowen Baker and Glenn Powell and Jonas Schneider and Josh Tobin and Maciek Chociej and Peter Welinder and Vikash Kumar and Wojciech Zaremba},
      Title = {Multi-Goal Reinforcement Learning: Challenging Robotics Environments and Request for Research},
      Year = {2018},
      Eprint = {arXiv:1802.09464},
    }

### Toy text

Toy environments which are text-based. There's no extra dependency to
install, so to get started, you can just do:

``` python
import gym
env = gym.make('FrozenLake-v1')
env.reset()
env.render()
```
